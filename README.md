# odin-recipes

This is a brief project in HTML making a website that contains recipes for dishes.
It will be a practice of me practicing git through the command line in my linux vm
It will be a practice of writing good commit messages in such that they are small and descript.
It will be a practice of HTML elements and best practices of HTML as well.
